Case Study I
The case study consists of analyzing two data files one is the beer data across various parameters and another one is the brewery data that has the information of brewery spread across various states.
This Readme file will be enhanced as we proceed.

Two rmd files have been uploaded in this repository and I would request you to go through and give the feedback. Comments are entered within the RMD files itself and it will tell what the code actually does.

Thank you for your time!
